MODEL: Qwen/Qwen3-8B
+ RAG - (over chunk split type, top k, needle size)
+ change run_training to support all needle types + needle_sizes
+ benchmark preseved utility
+ QA - optional run_training with QA or as is text
+ Lora - (needle size, (epochs, learnign rate, batch_size, adapter sizes, QA enabled)) - baseline (epoch = 5, learning_rate = 1e-3 to fixed batch_size, adapter_r = 6, adapter_layers = 8)
