The tapestry depicts the events leading up to the Norman conquest of England, and is now housed in the Musée de la Tapisserie in Bayeux, Normandy, France. The tapestry measures 230 feet long and about 20 inches high. It is made of linen, embroidered with coloured wool. The story is told in a sequence of panels, each depicting a scene from the narrative. The figures are depicted in a flat style, often with exaggerated proportions, and the action is conveyed through the use of inscriptions in Latin. The tapestry is a unique source of information about 11th-century life and warfare.
