Later, the sons of Emma and Ethelred returned to England, where they ruled until 1066. In 1066, the sons of Emma's second marriage to Normandy's Duke Robert I, William and Robert Curthose, claimed the English throne. They were defeated by Harold Godwinson at the Battle of Hastings, but the claim was not abandoned. After William's death in 1087, his sons Robert and William Rufus fought over the succession. William Rufus's death in 1100 led to another battle between his heir Henry I and Robert, who died in 1105. Henry I's death in 1135 sparked yet another conflict, this time between his son Stephen and his daughter Matilda. In 1139, Matilda's husband, Geoffrey of Anjou, invaded England, starting the civil war known as the Anarchy. Eventually, Matilda's son, Henry II, won the war and ruled from 1154 to 1189.
