In the High Middle Ages, the Normans deepened their control and influence through conquest, colonization and diplomacy in North Western Europe, Southern Italy and the Near East. The Normans are remembered for their contributions to the culture of southern Italy and Sicily, for their role in the Crusades, and for their distinctive art and architecture. The Normans spoke Old Norman, a Romance language derived from Old French.

Document 5:
William the Conqueror (1028 – 9 September 1087), also known as William I of England, was a Norman-French duke who conquered England in 1066. He was the son of Robert I, Duke of Normandy, and Herleva of Falaise. William succeeded his father as Duke of Normandy in 1035, and became King of England in 1066 after defeating Harold Godwinson at the Battle of Hastings. He was crowned on Christmas Day at Westminster Abbey, and ruled until his death. He was the first Norman king of England and the first Angevin king, being part of the Capetian dynasty. William's conquest of England was one of the most significant events in English history, leading to profound changes in the country's language, laws, and customs. The Conquest initiated a period of Anglo-Norman cultural dominance and led to the establishment of Norman as the language of the ruling classes, which persisted in England for centuries.
