Document 5:
The Norman conquest of southern Italy began in 999 when a small army of Normans from the Duchy of Normandy, led by two counts, William and Drogo, crossed into Apulia at the invitation of a dispossessed Byzantine nobleman. They defeated the Byzantines and their Lombard allies at the Battle of Civitate in 1003. After the battle, the Normans settled in the region and became increasingly Italianized. By the end of the 11th century, the Normans had taken control of the entire Mezzogiorno. Their success was due to their military prowess, which enabled them to take advantage of divisions within the Byzantine Empire and the machinations of rival Italian states. In 1060, Robert Guiscard captured Bari, the last Byzantine stronghold in Italy, and in 1071 his fleet helped the Byzantines defeat the Seljuk Turks at the Battle of Manzikert. By 1071, the Normans were in control of southern Italy.
