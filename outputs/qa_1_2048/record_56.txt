However, after the conquest of England, William the Conqueror sent a large force under the command of his half-brother Odo, bishop of Bayeux, to invade Wales. The Normans, led by Odo, defeated the Welsh in the Battle of Mynydd Mawr, and then laid siege to Chepstow Castle. After the fall of the castle, the Normans built a motte-and-bailey structure, which was later replaced by a stone keep. This castle became the nucleus of the town of Chepstow. The Normans then moved southwards, capturing Cardiff and building a similar castle there. They also captured Gwent, Glamorgan, and other territories. The Welsh resistance was sporadic but fierce. The Normans were able to establish themselves in the south-east of Wales, but they never succeeded in conquering the whole country. The Normans continued to expand their territory through the 11th century, but their progress was slow and often met with strong resistance from the Welsh.
