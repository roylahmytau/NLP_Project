William the Conqueror's invasion of England in 1066 was a turning point in British history. His victory at the Battle of Hastings led to the establishment of Norman rule in England and marked the transition from the Anglo-Saxon to the Norman period in English history. The Normans brought with them a new language, law, and culture. Many castles were built, and the Normans introduced the feudal system, which transformed the way land was held and controlled. The Normans also had a profound influence on the development of English literature and the English language. The Normans were also responsible for the construction of many of the great cathedrals and churches of England, including Westminster Abbey and Canterbury Cathedral. They also introduced the Norman style of architecture, which can be seen in many of the buildings that survive from this period.
