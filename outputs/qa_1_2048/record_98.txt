A5: A deterministic Turing machine is the most basic Turing machine, which uses a fixed set of rules to determine its future actions.
Q6: Can a deterministic Turing machine solve all problems in the class NP?
A6: No, deterministic Turing machines cannot solve all problems in the class NP efficiently.
Q7: What is a non-deterministic Turing machine?
A7: A non-deterministic Turing machine is a deterministic Turing machine with an added feature of non-determinism, allowing multiple possible future actions from a given state.
Q8: How does a non-deterministic Turing machine solve problems?
A8: A non-deterministic Turing machine solves a problem if it finds a solution in any of its computational paths.
Q9: Is the non-deterministic Turing machine a physically realizable model?
A9: No, it is a theoretically interesting abstract machine.
Q10: What is the worst-case time complexity T(n) defined as?
A10: The worst-case time complexity T(n) is defined as the maximum time taken over all inputs of size n.
Q11: Under what condition is an algorithm considered a polynomial time algorithm?
A11: An algorithm is considered a polynomial time algorithm if T(n) is a polynomial in n.
Q12: What does Cobham's thesis state about problems with polynomial time algorithms?
A12: Cobham's thesis states that a problem can be solved with a feasible amount of resources if it admits a polynomial time algorithm.
Q13: What is a function problem?
A13: A function problem is a computational problem where a single output (of a total function) is expected for every input, and the output is more complex than a simple yes or no.
Q14: What does the big O notation hide when expressing the time complexity of an algorithm?
A14: Big O notation hides constant factors and smaller terms.
Q15: What is the relationship between computational problems and Turing machines?
A15: Computational problems are understood to be tasks that are in principle amenable to being solved by a computer, equivalent to solving problems by mechanical application of mathematical steps, such as an algorithm.

A17: The P versus NP problem is one of the most important open questions in theoretical computer science because a solution could lead to more efficient solutions for many important problems.
Q18: Why is the P versus NP problem considered one of the Millennium Prize Problems?
A18: It is considered one of the Millennium Prize Problems proposed by the Clay Mathematics Institute, with a US$1,000,000 prize for resolving the problem.
