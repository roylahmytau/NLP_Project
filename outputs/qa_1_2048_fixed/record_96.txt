Q2: According to the document, what does Cobham's thesis state about problems that admit a polynomial time algorithm?
A2: Cobham's thesis states that a problem can be solved with a feasible amount of resources if it admits a polynomial time algorithm.

Q3: Which theorem helps in understanding the relationship between time and space requirements for solving problems?
A3: The time and space hierarchy theorems help in understanding the relationship between time and space requirements for solving problems.

Q4: What is the time complexity of the best known quantum algorithm for integer factorization, as mentioned in the document?
A4: The best known quantum algorithm for integer factorization, Shor's algorithm, runs in polynomial time.

Q5: How is the worst-case time complexity T(n) defined for a given input size n?
A5: The worst-case time complexity T(n) is defined to be the maximum time taken over all inputs of size n.
