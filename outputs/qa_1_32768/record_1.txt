A: A:... A: Excessive compression ("kick back"). Q: What does Document 43 discuss? A: It discusses overactive immune responses and autoimmune disorders. Q: What causes autoimmune disorders according to Document 43? A: They may result from genetic and environmental factors. Q: How is excessive compression caused in valve gears? A: By a short cutoff at admission which adversely affects the exhaust period, preventing the totality of exhaust steam from evacuating the cylinder, leading to choked exhaust and excessive compression. Q: What is the purpose of gradually "shortening the cutoff" in valve gears? A: To save steam by gaining speed and momentum. Q: What is the effect of keeping the exhaust and compression periods constant in valve gears? A: It should ideally always be kept fairly constant.

Q: What is the role of immunosuppressive drugs in treating autoimmune disorders? A: To reduce the activity of the immune system. Q: What happens when the exhaust event is too brief in valve gears? A: The totality of the exhaust steam cannot evacuate the cylinder, choking it and giving excessive compression. Q: How does the valve gear's reversing mechanism help in steam engines? A: It provides means for saving steam by gradually shortening the admission event. Q: What is the effect of a short admission event on the exhaust and compression periods in valve gears? A: It adversely affects these periods. Q: What type of immune dysfunction does Document 43 focus on? A: Overactive immune responses, particularly autoimmune disorders. Q: How do autoimmune disorders occur according to Document 43? A: When the immune system mistakenly attacks normal tissues of the body, mistaking them for foreign invaders. Q: What is the ideal state for exhaust and compression periods in valve gears? A: They should be kept fairly constant. Q: What is the main difference between Document 42 and Document 43? A: Document 42 discusses valve gears and their operation, while Document 43 discusses autoimmune disorders. Q: What is the role of the valve in valve gears? A: It controls both steam flows during the engine cycle. Q: What happens when the totality of exhaust steam cannot evacuate the cylinder in valve gears? A: It chokes the cylinder and gives excessive compression. Q: What is the purpose of gradually shortening the admission event in valve gears? A: To gain speed and momentum by saving steam. Q: What is the consequence of an overly brief exhaust event in valve gears? A: It leads to excessive compression. Q: How can the steam engine's rotation direction be changed in valve gears? A: Through a reversing mechanism. Q: What is the effect of gradually shortening the admission event on the expansion period in valve gears? A: It proportionately lengthens the expansion period. Q: What is the effect of a short admission event on the exhaust period in valve gears? A: It adversely affects the exhaust period. Q: What is the effect of a short admission event on the compression period in valve gears? A: It adversely affects the compression period.
