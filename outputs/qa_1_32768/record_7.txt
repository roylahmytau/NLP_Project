Q: What is the role of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) in the immune system?
A: Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) play key roles in tissue homeostasis, immunity, and inflammation. They are divided into three main subsets: natural killer (NK) cells, group 1 ILCs (ILC1s), and group 2 ILCs (ILC2s). NK cells recognize and kill virus-infected or transformed cells. ILC1s promote cell-mediated immunity against intracellular pathogens by producing IFN-Œ≥. ILC2s secrete cytokines involved in allergic responses and parasitic infections.
