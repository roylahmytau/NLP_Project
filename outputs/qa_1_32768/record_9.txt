A: During the compression stage, relatively little work is required to drive the pump because the working fluid is in its liquid phase. :107-109 Q: How does the behavior of the working fluid change during the compression stage in the Rankine cycle? A: It remains in the liquid phase until just before the end of the process, then begins to vaporize. :107-109 Q: Why is additional work needed near the end of the compression stage in the Rankine cycle? A: The fluid is superheated and needs to be compressed into a gas. :107-109 Q: What allows the Rankine cycle to achieve higher efficiency compared to other cycles? A: The relatively low work required during the compression stage when the fluid is in its liquid phase. :107-109 Q: What happens to the working fluid just before the end of the compression stage in the Rankine cycle? A: It begins to vaporize. :107-109 Q: Why is additional work needed to continue compressing the fluid into a gas in the Rankine cycle?

Q: What does it mean for a problem to be hard for a complexity class?
A: A problem X is hard for a class of problems C if every problem in C can be reduced to X. Thus no problem in C is harder than X, since an algorithm for X allows us to solve any problem in C. To show that a problem is hard for a class, we typically reduce a known hard problem to our problem. If successful, this demonstrates that our problem is at least as hard as the known hard problem.
Q: These problems are at least as hard as any problem in NP. To show a problem is NP-hard, it must be proven that every problem in NP can be reduced to it in polynomial time. This implies that if an efficient algorithm exists for solving an NP-hard problem, then all problems in NP would also have efficient algorithms. Q: What does it mean for a problem to be NP-hard?
