The Eiffel Tower is a wrought-iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France.
    It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower.
    Constructed from 1887 to 1889 as the entrance to the 1889 World's Fair, it was initially
    criticized by some of France's leading artists and intellectuals for its design, but it
    has become a global cultural icon of France and one of the most recognizable structures in the world.
    The tower is 330 metres (1,083 ft) tall, about the same height as an 81-storey building,
    and is the tallest structure in Paris.
