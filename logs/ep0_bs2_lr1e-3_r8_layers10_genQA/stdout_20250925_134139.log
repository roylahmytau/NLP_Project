First, I need to recall the main branches of theoretical computer science. There's computational complexity theory, algorithms, automata theory, etc. The question mentions classifying problems by difficulty and their class relationships. 

Computational complexity theory deals with categorizing problems based on their inherent difficulty, like P, NP, NP-complete, etc. It

Question: By what main attribute are computational problems classified utilizing computational complexity theory? 
Expected: inherent difficulty
Predicted: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the main attribute used to classify computational problems in computational complexity theory. 

First, I need to recall what computational complexity theory focuses on. From what I remember, computational complexity theory deals with the resources required to solve computational problems. The primary resources considered are time and space. But the question is about the main attribute used for classification.

Wait, the question specifies "main attribute." So, while both time and space are important,

Question: What is the term for a task that generally lends itself to being solved by a computer?
Expected: computational problems
Predicted: <think>
Okay, let's see. The user is asking for the term that describes a task suited for a computer. I remember from my studies that there's a specific term for this. Let me think... Oh right, it's "computational task." Wait, but maybe there's another term. Let me check the documents provided.

Looking at the documents, the first one mentions "computational tasks" in the context of parallel computing. The second document talks about "computational problems" and

Question: What measure of a computational problem broadly defines the inherent difficulty of the solution?
Expected: if its solution requires significant resources
Predicted: <think>
Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the measure of a computational problem that defines its inherent difficulty. Hmm, I remember from my studies that computational complexity is the term used here. But wait, let me make sure.

The question mentions "inherent difficulty of the solution." So, what's the key concept here? Computational complexity theory deals with classifying computational problems based on their inherent difficulty. But there are different measures. For example, time complexity and space complexity
